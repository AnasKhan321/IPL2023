				<h1>IPL 2023 - Indian Premrier League </h1>
				
				<p>The 2023 Indian Premier League (also known as Tata IPL 2023 for sponsorship reasons and sometimes referred to as IPL 2023 or IPL 16) was the 16th season of the Indian Premier League, a franchise Twenty20 cricket league in India. It is organised by the Board of Control for Cricket in India.[1]

In the final, Chennai Super Kings defeated Gujarat Titans, by five wickets (DLS method) to win their record fifth league title.[2]

Background[edit]
The league returned to its original home-and-away format after a period of four years.[3] Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the previous three seasons were held at neutral venues.[4] "Fan parks" were organised in 45 cities, events which last occurred in 2019,[5][a] and an opening ceremony took place for the first time with performances from Arijit Singh, Tamannaah Bhatia, and Rashmika Mandanna.[6][7]The teams are divided into two groups (A and B) of five teams. Each team plays twice against all five teams in the other group (home and away), and once against all four of the teams in its own group. All teams play seven home and seven away games.[21]</p>

				<h1>Champion : CSK</h1>
				
				<p>Finishing 9th in the group stage in the 2022 IPL, CSK was looking forward to the IPL auction 2023.[77] They bagged Ben Stokes for whopping INR 16.25 crore while Kyle Jamieson was bought for one crore and test specialist Ajinkya Rahane for half of that. However, their bowling unit was in lack of experience with the New Zealander Adam Milne and the Englishman Chris Jordan was released from the franchise.[78] The tournament's all-time purple cap holder Dwayne Bravo retired and re-signed with the team as their bowling coach.[79]

At the beginning of the season, CSK faced further difficulties when their main pacer Deepak Chahar was sidelined for 6 matches and the expensive pick Ben Stokes had a sore heel and had to rest for almost the entire season.[80] Their newly brought pacer Kyle Jamieson was out of the tournament with an injury before even the season began and the South African pacer Sisanda Magala was brought in as his replacement.[81]

The team finished the group stage with 17 points and 8 wins under their name and classified for the first qualifier ahead of Lucknow Super Giants who had the same point score but a lower net run rate.[82] CSK won the qualifier against the table toppers Gujarat Titans at home, making it into their 10th IPL finals in 14 seasons.[83] In the final which was held in Ahmedabad, Chennai Super Kings beat the defending champions Gujarat Titans by 5 wickets (DLS Method) to win their 5th title.[84][85] Ambati Rayudu, who was a part of the team since 2018, announced his retirement from IPL before the final match.[86]</p>

				<h1>Highest Wicket Taker: Mohammed Shami Ahmed</h1>
				
				<p>Shami is a right-arm fast bowler[153] who has the ability to move the ball off the seam and using swing, including reverse swing, to move the ball both ways.[154] He has bowled persistently at around 140 km/h (87 mph),[155] with his highest bowling speed being 153.2 km/h against Australia during the 2014 series at MCG.[156] According to ESPNcricinfo, the secret of Shami's success lies in his wrist with his run-up and action being quite smooth.[157] Earlier he used to be accused of straying to leg once too often for searching wickets, but now he has shifted the line of attack to the left ever so slightly. As a result, when he bowls in the channel, he really does bowl in the channel.[158] His wicket taking ability and bowling reverse swing make him one of the lethal bowlers of the world[159] and which is why he has been described as 'unplayable' at times regardless of the formats.[144]He was purchased by Gujarat Titans, a newly formed franchise, for ₹6.25 crore (US$780,000) from the marquee group of players.[50] He took 20 wickets at an economy rate of 8.00 runs per over during the season as Gujarat won the league title in their first season.[51] He set new career best T20 bowling figures the following season, taking his first four-wicket haul in the format against Delhi.[52] The same season, he won the Purple Cap (leading wicket-taker) for the first time, with 28 wickets from 17 matches,[53][54] besides being the leading wicket-taker in the powerplay in a season in the history of the league, taking 17 wickets in all during the phase.[55][56]</p>
